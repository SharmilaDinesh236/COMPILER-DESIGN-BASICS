Description:
To build a simple Lexical Analyzer in C that:

Reads a source code file (myfile.txt)

Identifies and prints:

Keywords (e.g., int, if, return)

Identifiers (e.g., variable names like a, main)

Operators (e.g., +, -, =, etc.)

Tool Type	Name: 
Editor   : VS Code 
Compiler : DEV C++
Language : C Programming Language	
OS	     : Windows 
File	   : myfile.txt

The compiler design basics program written in C successfully performs the basic task of tokenizing input from a source code file. It accurately classifies keywords, identifiers, and operators by scanning the file character by character.

This project provides a fundamental understanding of:

How lexical analysis is done in compilers,

How to use file handling, string manipulation, and character testing in C.
